* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 

AppZen’s intended customer is any finance team that wants to remain compliant while focusing on higher valued tasks. Their customers are larger companies that have thousands of transactions that need to be audited. AppZen’s main competitor is Expensify, which offers similar services except for FCPA compliance. Larger companies, like Amazon, use AppZen because their software can audit domestic and international invoices for bribery and fraud.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

AppZen, uses Artificial Intelligence to develop their products. “The AppZen artificial intelligence platform uses a combination of deep learning, machine learning, and semantic modeling.” Their products can also integrate with other systems such as Workday.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? 

“AppZen has developed the world's first artificial intelligence (AI) solution for back office automation.” AppZen’s impact has made it easier for finance teams to focus on other tasks. Their AI solution not only helps with compliance, it also analyzes spending and advises where money is being wasted.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

The Regtech domain releases the Regtech100 which is a list of top 100 companies in the industry that is released every year. The Regtech 100 is determined based on a series of criteria such as innovation, efficiency, and growth. AppZen made the Regtech 100 list in 2018 but has not been included on the list recently.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? Although 

AppZen does not show up on lists of top RegTech firms, they are still considered to be a well performing company. They provide services for some of the largest and well-known companies and have received more funding than their competitors.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

My recommendation for AppZen would be to have a mobile platform. Their main competitor, Expensify, provides an app in which their users can take a picture of their receipts for expense reports. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

As more people are starting to work remotely, the convenience of an app would perhaps increase productivity for AppZen users.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

AppZen would use the same technologies for their app. In addition, they may also need to use Swift or Java to make the app compatible for Apple and Android devices.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

AppZen would need to use Java programming because it is the official language for Android development, and they would use Swift for the Apple development.
